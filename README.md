### Platform

Linux

### Editor

For development I use [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) as Operating System and my editor is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because it is simple to use, learning curve is less and comes with lots build int features like [emmet](https://emmet.io/) features and extensions. However, I have learned basics of [vim](https://www.vim.org/) for working on servers.

### Programming experience

I have significant knowledge of programming, when I first started to learn programming in high school where I have started my first language with `Python` i was fascinated by it. Afterwards I started to explore various fields but Web Development caught my interest I have created some project using `Django` Framework. Then, I started to learn `JavaScript` such that I can learn `React` for front-end. Then I started contributing to `Open Source` to learn new things and it was great for exploration. I have learned a lot from Open Source and met a lot of amazing people.

### JavaScript experience

I've been having a great time learning JavaScript and working with it on front-end projects in open source environments. The best part about `JavaScript` is that you can literally build anything with it, from mobile apps with frameworks like [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to web apps, games, and much more. Recently, I even came across a project where they built a whole operating system in the browser called [OS.js](https://www.os-js.org/)

On the flip side, JavaScript's loose typing can lead to problems if you don't use tools like [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to add type safety. While [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) can help with documentation, it doesn't enforce types. Another challenge is **callback hell** where nested callbacks can make code difficult to read and maintain.

Here are some of my works with `JavaScript`:
- Checkout [my personal site](https://t27.vercel.app/) which I have created while I was learning `Svelte` [link to Repo](https://github.com/the-r3aper7/personal-site-v2).
- Checkout [Next.js file server](https://github.com/the-r3aper7/nextjs-file-server) which I have created while I was learning `Next.js`.
- Revamped the media page of [Qwik](https://qwik.dev) checkout the [PR](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/pull/4970).
- Small Changes to Sidebar to [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/docs/getting-started/) checkout the [PR](https://qwik.dev/docs/getting-started/).
- Another Small Improvement in [Qwik's Media Page](https://qwik.dev/media/#blogs) checkout the [PR](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/pull/4659).
- Here is a [website](https://achievechessacademy.com/) which I have created for client in 24hrs.


### Node.js experience

I haven't directly worked with `Node.js` yet, but I did leverage the API features of Next.js v12 to create a file server interface for a local network. This project allowed for basic upload, download, and streaming functionalities. Check it out on GitHub here: [Nextjs File Server](https://github.com/the-r3aper7/nextjs-file-server.)

I'm definitely interested in getting more hands-on experience with `Node.js` in the future.

### C/Fortran experience

While I haven't had the chance to create a full project in C yet, I did take a course in `Programming for Problem Solving in C` during college. This course involved implementing basic algorithms in C, which provided a strong foundation in the language's core concepts.

### Interest in stdlib

While I'm still developing my knowledge of statistics and machine learning algorithms, I've been impressed by the `stdlib-js/stdlib` library. It offers a collection of smaller, focused packages instead of a single, massive library that could bloat your bundle size. What particularly excites me is the ability to perform NumPy-like operations directly in the browser. The plotting API seems like a fantastic example of this functionality. I've also found the stdlib community to be very welcoming and approachable.

### Version control

Yes, Currently I am using Git as primary VCS.

### Goals

# Abstract

Stdlib is a Open Source Project written in `JavaScript`, Stdlib provides 3000+ high performance packages which can be used for numerical and scientific computation, statistics. Since, it is written in `JavaScript` we can used it any where some mobile via `react-native`, `Node.js` and `Browsers`. My proposal is to create a developer dashboard for tracking build status of those 3000+ repository. We may want to achieve this using `Reactjs` and `Fastify` for backend which will serve static files and API responses.

# Description for Project

For my project I am going to implement these designs and use these libraries:

- [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) is great for build tool as it provide various features like `code-splitting`, `optimized builds` and `faster workflows`.
- [Reactjs](https://react.dev/) is a popular framework for building websites. Since, we are in initial stages we may not want to bloat the application with various technology let's go simple and clear. This may be the project structure for our frontend part of website.

    - `components` - where we will store all our components like `Tables.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `Chip.tsx` and many more...
    - `hooks` - where we will store all our custom hooks here are some hooks like 
        - `useDebounced.tsx` for delayed input from search bar. 
        - `useBuildData()` for fetching data from API endpoint this may take input in form of object of filters such that we can get required data from server.
        - `useSearch()` for fetching data from `/search?q=` API endpoint.
    - `context` Since, we are making it leaner and simple we may want to use [Reactjs Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) to avoid prop drilling we may store recently fetched data, search query and as project requirement while developing.  
    - `constants` - we will store all constants like `API` urls this may be removed as per suggestion.
  
  ### Communication with APIs
    Since, we are seeking the project to be as simple as possible so we will use [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) which is used by browsers natively for communication which APIs we can create a Component say for rendering table data.

    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';

    class Table extends React.Component {

      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          data: null,
          error: null,
          loading: false,
        };
        this.controllerRef = React.createRef(null);
      }

      componentDidMount() {
        this.fetchData();
      }

      componentWillUnmount() {
        if (this.controllerRef.current) {
          this.controllerRef.current.abort();
        }
      }

      fetchData = async () => {
        this.setState({ loading: true, error: null });

        if (!this.controllerRef.current) {
          this.controllerRef.current = new AbortController();
        }

        const { signal } = this.controllerRef.current;

        try {
          const response = await fetch(this.props.url, { ...this.props.options, signal });

          if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
          }

          const fetchedData = await response.json();
          this.setState({ data: fetchedData }); // we will also use this data to update the context too
        } catch (error) {
          if (error.name !== 'AbortError') {
            this.setState({ error });
          }
        } finally {
          this.setState({ loading: false });
        }
      };

      render() {

        const { data, error, loading } = this.state;

        if (loading) {
          return <p>Loading...</p>;
        }

        if (error) {
          return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
        }

        return (
          // renders table data
        );
      }
    }

    export default GetData;
    ```
    
    > **NOTE!** this a mockup component in project it might change. 
    >
    > Here, props will take `{ url: string }`

    Now, we easily render table data with changing url and store the api response to a context as it would be easy to modify the data when user clicks on `Sort Icon` as this would be deeply nested.

- [postgres](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres) we can use this library querying data from database directly in `JSON` format which we can be easily used for formatting and sending it to `frontend` for rendering.

- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) as the name suggest it fast and less overhead for creating REST API's. Fastify Ecosytem provides lots of plugins which will make DX easier and simpler. Since, we will be serving our react app from same port as `Fastify` this will avoid the process of `CORS`.

    Currently for creating basic REST API routes for this service:
    - `/` (**GET**): for serving `index.html` file.
    - `/assets` (**GET**): for serving static files like css, js, svgs etc.
    - `/search` (**GET**): in this route we will implement basic search in sql.
        - `q`  (**required**) (type: string) for querying by package-name. 
          
          > Here, are some DX improving shortcuts to search.
          >
          > ### Basic Syntax will `[header cell/filter type]=[...]`
          > - if type is string then use `^`.
          > - if type is number then use `-`_(for range)_, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`.
          >
          > 1) Initially when you type into search bar it will search for package which contains the package name in SQL which will look like this `select packagename from packages packagname like '%q%'` (**NOTE JUST A MOCK QUERY**).
          >
          > 2) Suppose you want to search for package.
          >     - Starts with given query you can type `name=^name-of-package`.
          >     - Ends with given query you can type `name=name-of-package^`.
          >     - if you type `name=name-of-package` this will be treated as default.
          >     - Examples: `name=^iter`
          >
          > 3) Suppose you want to filter your searches based on stars which is a number.
          >     - Range of star you can type `stars=1-10`
          >     - Less than a specifc number you can type `stars=<10`
          >     - Greater than or Equal a specifc number you can type `stars=<=10`
          >
          > 4) You can also combine multiple shortcut which is delimetered by ' ' will look like this.
          >     - stars which ranges from 1 to 10, having `math` in there package name you can type something like `name=^math stars=1-10`.

        - `page` (**required**) ( type: integer ) which will be useful for pagination.
        - `size` (**required**) ( type: integer ) size of table rows which will render on client side.
        - `filters` (**required**) ( type: string delimetered by "," )  we can use these serve only the data required by the client.

# Project Documentation
To ensure the codebase remains well-documented, I plan to incorporate documentation updates with each pull request (PR) I submit. This way, the documentation burden stays manageable, especially as deadlines approach. Specifically, I'll focus on documenting the changes I introduce in each PR, keeping the overall documentation up-to-date without requiring a separate, time-consuming documentation task.

# Roadmap to Historical overviews and other drill down metrics.

- ## Extending API
  - `/metrics/:package-id` (**GET**) which will take these search params.
      - `type` (**required**) ( type: string delimetered by "," ) this mean we can have `downloads`, `code coverage`, `build failures` and many more .

      ### Response Skeleton

      ```js
      {
        pkgName: string,
        githubURl: string,
        documentation: string,
        data: {
          downloads: [
            { date: string, value: number },
            ...
          ],
          codeCoverage: [

          ]
          // add more data as defined in type
        },
      }
      ```

### Why this project?

I'm particularly enthusiastic about this project because it allows me to leverage my skills to create a tool that will positively impact the community. Even more exciting, I can apply the frontend development skills I've honed through contributions to various open-source projects, along with my experience creating and working with APIs. This project presents a fantastic opportunity to put my knowledge and experience to work on something truly valuable.

With the help of the developer dashboard, we can quickly view which packages have problems in their build status. This allows us to address issues for specific packages easily. Without the dashboard, you would have to go to every single package repository to check their build statuses. By using the dashboard, we can navigate and work more efficiently.

### Qualifications

I've made significant contributions to several well-respected frameworks. Here are some highlights:
- [Qwik's website](https://qwik.dev/) a frontend framework which introduced `Resumability` to frontend world.
    - I helped enhance the user experience of Qwik's website by redesigning the [Media Page](https://qwik.dev/media) 
    - I'm also nearing completion on the development of the [package manager tabs](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/pull/5649) which will be integrated into production soon.
- [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/)
    - Implementing a production-ready [url generator copy button](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/11317) using [stimulusjs](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/)
    - Migration of components from vanillajs to [stimulusjs](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) here are some migrations [enableDirtyFormCheck](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/11373) and [tabs.js](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/11542)

In addition to my open-source experience, I'm currently enrolled in a **`Database Management System (DBMS)``* course at college. This course is equipping me with the skills to execute queries efficiently and apply optimization techniques, which I'm eager to leverage in this project.

### Prior art

Yes, there is similar project like this from [npm](https://npm.github.io/statusboard/) where they are also tracking the build status, total downloads and many more things. From what I have understand from their [Github Repo](https://github.com/npm/statusboard)

they have created a folder named `workspaces` which contains 2 projects
- `www` from here they are serving simple **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS** and using [jquery](https://jquery.com/) for DOM manipulation.
- `data` from here they are serving their content from REST service or [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) as needed.

All these things are automated by using GitHub Actions.

### Commitment

I plan on devoting my entire summer to this. I won't have any other kind of job, so I will be able to work a standard 40 hour week for the coding period. Also, my classes will end well before the coding period begins and will not start up again until well after the pencils down date, so I will be totally free for the whole period.

Notes:

- The community bonding period is a 3 week period built into GSoC to help you get to know the project community and participate in project discussion. This is an opportunity for you to setup your local development environment, learn how the project's source control works, refine your project plan, read any necessary documentation, and otherwise prepare to execute on your project project proposal.
- Usually, even week 1 deliverables include some code.
- By week 6, you need enough done at this point for your mentor to evaluate your progress and pass you. Usually, you want to be a bit more than halfway done.
- By week 11, you may want to "code freeze" and focus on completing any tests and/or documentation.
- During the final week, you'll be submitting your project.
